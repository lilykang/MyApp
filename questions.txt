1. stdint.h is a library or a header that contains function "typedef" which allow users to 
define the type of a variable and specify the number of bits it needs to store its value 
using the binary system

2. uint8, uint16, and uint64 are, respectively, 8-, 16-, and 64-bit unsigned integers. 
int32 is a 32-bit signed integer. They are used to limit how many bits each type of variable 
can have for storage.

3. Hex:0x424d

4. bfSize is the total number of bytes in a file whereas biSize is the total number of bytes in the info header

5. A negative biHeight means a top-down DIB. biCompression must be either BI_RGB or BI_BITFIELDS. Top-down DIBs cannot be compressed.

6. biBitCount defines the number of bits in each pixel and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap

7. fopen might return null if the user does not have the right access control over those files 
(read and write for infile and out file, respectively) or the file is corrupt or does not exist. 

8. The third argument in fread is the number of times the file is read. We only want the file to be read once.

9. Padding is 3

10. fseek allows you to offset the file pointer. In copy.c, the program use fseek to forward the location of the pointer by 
the size of the padding from the current location 

11. SEEK_CUR is the current location of the pointer
