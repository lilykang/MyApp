= Restructuring Strings

== Answers

1. The advantage of the alternative representation is the ease of knowing the length of the string. Instead
of using strlen, the user can now use s[0] as strlen and know precisely how long the word is. Additionally,
the counting of characters in the word itself starts with 1, which can be more intuitive for some people. 

2. The disadvantage of the alternative representation of string is that it can be hard to keep track of where each 
string ends. With the trailing "\0," the user can loop through a series of strings and treating each one as a separate
entity that ends with "\0." With s[0] now being the beginning of a string, it can be hard to know when the string ends, 
especially when the string itself contains a number. For example, when the string itself is "hello1," the system would not know 
whether the nunmber 1 is the beginning of the next string or if it is part of a string. Additionally, when the word gets longer than 9 characters, say 14,
the length of the word could occupy two grids and the computer might be confused as to whether that stands for the
length of the word or whether the number is part of the word. 

3. 

size_t strlen(const char *s)
{
    s = get_string();
    return s[0];
    
}
